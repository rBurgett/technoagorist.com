My name is Ryan, and I am an agorist. Today we are talking about the importance of stopping, of taking a pause in the midst of the chaos to find the truth.

Holy wow, the world seems to be melting down. I can't go anywhere on the internet at this point without being inundated with everything COVID-19. Whole countries are shutting down. States in the US are shutting down. Cities are shutting down. Store shelves are empty as are major roadways. The stock market is down and unemployment is at an all time high! Yikes! It's the end of the world!

Or, is it?

I made an episode a while back which was titled, "[The Importance of Perspective.](https://technoagorist.com/20)" In it, I talked about how our inner state is determined by how we perceive the world around us. If all we can see is darkness, then we will be full of that same darkness.

Now, we live in dark times. Bizarre, strange, surreal times. If that is all we see, then that is how we will feel as well. Is this the end of the word? I don't know. Maybe. But, hopefully not. The thing is, even if it is the end of the world, how do you want to spend it? Do you want to spend your last days lost, confused, and scared?

Heck no! Nobody should want that.

The reality is that we are humans and we are the most capable creatures on this planet. If I was to make a bet with Darwin, I'd say the skinny, hairless beasts with small muscles, fragile bones, and flat teeth would likely be the first to go in this dog-eat-dog world. Yet, here we are.

We are humans. We survive. But, even more so we thrive in all parts of this world and have done so for countless thousands of years. There is no virus and no government that can remove that legacy from us. We are most human when we stand tall in the midst of fear and uncertainty.

The reality is that you are the same person you were a day ago, a week ago, even a year ago! You are you, and no virus can change that. Your home is still your home and your family is still your family. You still have a roof over your head and a bed to lay in at night. You still have running water and sewage disposal. Now, you might need to make some adjustments regarding what you eat, but you still have food to eat. You still have your car. You are still in control of your own body.

Don't let yourself get sucked down the hole of darkness and despair that is the news and social media today. Take a moment to stop, to pause. I want you to go outside and look up at the sky. Feel the warmth of the sun on your face and the breeze against your cheek. Take a moment to not think about what everyone else is freaking out about, but instead to remind yourself of what remains. Hold your hands out in front of you and turn your palms up, then slowly let out a deep breath.

You are going to make it.

This is Techno-Agorist episode 38.
