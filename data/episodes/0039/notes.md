My name is Ryan and I am an agorist. Today we are talking about submission signaling.

I find it very difficult to watch the news or listen to podcasts these days. They are dark and depressing. It's all terror porn and I really don't need that in my life. The one exception for me is [Ron Paul's Liberty Report](https://soundcloud.com/ron-paul-liberty-report). I listen to every episode of it because I love Dr. Paul's infectious optimism. The world needs more like him. I wish that I was more like him!

In a [recent episode](https://soundcloud.com/ron-paul-liberty-report/corona-masks-infection-preventionor-submission-signaling), he spoke about what he calls "Corona masks" and asked whether they are really about infection prevention, or if they are just a means of "signaling submission."

Obviously, we know that N95 masks actually can filter out bad stuff. But, is that what officials are demanding that people wear? No. They tell people to just put something--anything--over their faces. As long as there is something over your face, you are good. But, as Dr. Paul and countless others have pointed out, if the point of masks is to prevent the spread of a virus, then the little pieces of cloth people wear over their faces are pointless.

He then asked, "What is the point?" According to Dr. Paul, it is all psychological. Ever since the days of Nazi Germany, people worry about a day when the government will demand to see your papers! It's a sign of authoritarian government if you can't move around and take care of your business without showing papers. He then went on to describe Corona masks as "papers on your face."

These masks would not and could not stop the spread of a virus. They are outward signs of submission to authoritarian government. Here in Pennsylvania, as in New York and California, during the worst of COVID-19, it was policy to move people infected with the virus INTO NURSING HOMES. Theses governments intentionally moved the sickest people into enclosed areas with the most vulnerable people! This intentional move on the part of these murderous governors led to countless unnecessary deaths. If you don't count the deaths that took place in nursing homes, the death rate for COVID-19 is statistically zero.

Are these the kind of people who you want to signal submission to? Everything about this virus response has been political, from the beginning. The authoritarians in government have accomplished more in the last few months than in twenty years of exploiting global warming or climate change or whatever they call it now.

In PA, we are entering the "green phase." Yay! That is the last and final stage of opening up. Yet, businesses and churches are still heavily regulated, forced to limit their patrons. Social distancing is required. Buffets are closed and you won't even believe what's coming to public schools in the fall. And on top of all this, we still are required, you heard that, REQUIRED, to wear masks. Governor Wolf reiterated that last week.

They want us to believe that this is the new normal, with the government telling every business exactly how to do business, telling churches how to worship, and telling us to wear these stupid masks.

I haven't worn a mask once since this all began and I won't. I have snuck past a cop guarding the grocery store. I have been hollered at by hysterical people. I have been threatened. My wife has received much worse while out in public without a mask.

It is discouraging that over the last nearly three months, I have only seen one single shopper other than myself or my wife out without a mask on. One single customer at the grocery store without a mask on their face. But, you know what, I can't control the feelings of others. What I can control is how I live. I refuse to signal submission to these authoritarians. I refuse to be a part of the problem.

When Governor Wolf leaves his mansion and looks out upon his subjects, I want him to see that lone face in the crowd without a mask on their face. I want him to be reminded that no matter how hard he pushes, he does not own me. Hopefully, I'm not the only one.

This is Techno-Agorist, episode 39.
